## Overview

<img src="./screenshot.jpeg" alt="404-page">

- Where can I see your demo?
You can see the demo by clicking [here](https://hb-404-lading-page.netlify.app/)

- What was your experience?
The challenge was to create a 404 landing page. I made use of flexbox to achieve the results. I had learnt about CSS flexbox and this challenge helped me check my thorough knowledge on the same. 

- What have you learned/improved?
While using flexbox, make sure you specify the widths of the child element or else the justify-content: space-betweem would not work.
